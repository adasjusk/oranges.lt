<p>Light up your homes, caves, mineshaft and lives with the glow berry. Build a spyglass and peep your next adventure or just keep track of what that creeper over yonder is doing.<br /></p>

      <p>With the approaching transition from Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, we will need to end support for Windows XP and Windows Vista. This will also result in the end of support for the legacy launcher. You can read more about the account migration here -&gt; <a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-JAVA-Account-Migration-FAQ">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-JAVA-Account-Migration-FAQ</a></p>

<p>Effective in Q2 2021, we will end support for both platforms and the legacy launcher.

    <h3>Minecraft 1.16 - Nether Update</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>One does not simply walk into the Nether, but it seems that’s what everyone is about to do anyway…<br /></p>

<p>Today we’re releasing the full Nether Update in all its glory! Traverse through familiar, fiery wastes into new unexplored fungal forests, spooky valleys, and deltas brimming with basalt.<br /></p>

<p>Dig your way through these biomes and you might be able to find a new curious material, suspiciously titled “ancient debris”. What will you make of it (it’s totally not Netherite)?<br /></p>

<p>Fight your way through hordes of Piglins… Or don’t! They’re actually pretty cool if you bring some bling. And in case you find yourself in the wrong end of a bargain, make sure that you have access to a functional respawn anchor.<br /></p>

<p>I advise you to not use your regular bed unless you’re feeling a bit… “adventurous”.<br /></p>
