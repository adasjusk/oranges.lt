<p>Light up your homes, caves, mineshaft and lives with the glow berry. Build a spyglass and peep your next adventure or just keep track of what that creeper over yonder is doing.<br /></p>

    <h3>Minecraft 1.16 - Nether Update</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>One does not simply walk into the Nether, but it seems that’s what everyone is about to do anyway…<br /></p>

<p>Today we’re releasing the full Nether Update in all its glory! Traverse through familiar, fiery wastes into new unexplored fungal forests, spooky valleys, and deltas brimming with basalt.<br /></p>

<p>Fight your way through hordes of Piglins… Or don’t! They’re actually pretty cool if you bring some bling. And in case you find yourself in the wrong end of a bargain, make sure that you have access to a functional respawn anchor.<br /></p>

<p>I advise you to not use your regular bed unless you’re feeling a bit… “adventurous”.<br /></p>

    <h3>Minecraft 1.14 - Village & Pillage</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>Apparently, it takes a village to raise a child. Frankly, if we’d known how much work putting together the biggest Minecraft update yet was going to be, we’d have probably taken the easy option and tried to raise that child instead.<br /></p>

<p>But it was all worth it for this, <strong>Village &amp; Pillage</strong> Update release day! I can almost hear the Pillagers firing their crossbows into the air in celebration! Or are they firing them towards me…<br /></p>

<p>Enjoy the update!<br /></p>
