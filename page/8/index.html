    <h3>Minecraft Beta 1.6.5</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>There are some annoying bed bugs in multiplayer in this version, I’ll fix those next week.</p>

<p>1.6.5:</p>

<p>* Tweaked the connection reading code a lot. Hopefully this helps.<br />
* Changed the “limit framerate” option to a “framerate cap” option.<br />
* Added “Advanced OpenGL” again<br />
* Players riding anything or sleeping in anything will stop doing so when they leave the game now<br />
* Removed the minecraft version number from the main game window. It’s still available in the title screen<br />
* Fixed some entities appearing to fall through the ground repeatedly in multiplayer (some might still do so)<br />
* Fixed the server sometimes thinking the player hit a corner when walking when they didn’t<br />
* Fixed dropped damaged items vanishing after a single use after being picked up<br />
* Fixed dropped items not getting ejected from blocks properly<br />
* Fixed the achievements window rendering some graphics outside the clip window<br />
* Fixed players saving while sneaking being loaded too high up<br />
* Fixed shift+click transferring items causing a crash when the target container is full<br />
* Fixed lighting updates sometimes not happening correctly<br />
* Fixed the players health appearing to be full when entering/exiting the nether<br />
* Fixed a couple of instances where beds would act strange in multiplayer, primarily the “already occupied” bug<br /></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Minecraft Beta 1.6.4</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>* Fixed 1.6.3 using more CPU despite it claiming to use less<br />
* Totally professional<br /></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Minecraft Beta 1.6.3</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>1.6.3:</p>

<p>+ The renderer is now capped at 100 fps while there are chunks to be generated. The excess time will be spent generating chunks instead of rendering frames<br />
+ The “limit framerate” option now limits the game to 40 fps and will spend at least 10 ms per frame sleeping<br />
+ The “limit framerate” option has been reset to “off” for all players, enable it again if you want it<br />
* Fixed some block updates not updating lighting properly under some circumstances by reverting the “don’t always send block data” fix in 1.6<br />
* Fixed a major CPU load issue in the server where a very tight loop would starve all other threads<br />
* Fixed furnaces dropping/duplicating their contents when they change state from lit to unlit or back<br /></p>

<p>1.6.2:</p>

<p>* Fixed an ACTUAL item duplication bug while picking up some items<br /></p>

<p>1.6.1:</p>

<p>* Fixed a visual item duplication bug when trying to pick up items while the inventory is full<br /></p>

    </div>

    <h3>Minecraft Beta 1.5</h3>    <div class="content">

<p>* Weather (rain, snow, thunder)<br />
* Statistics<br />
* Achievements<br />
* Detector rail<br />
* Booster rail<br />
* Performance improvements<br /></p>

<p>More statistics and achievements will be added over time as we develop the game. They’re only stored locally at the moment, but we’ll slowly be rolling out online storing of achievements over time.</p>

  <div style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Minecraft Beta 1.4_01</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>* Removed the April fools joke<br /></p>

<p>(The server was updated as well, but it’s an optional update)</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top:16px">

  <div style="margin-top:16px">

  <div style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Welcome to the new Minecraft Launcher</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>This area will be used to inform you about game updates and other important news about the game. It’s highly likely we’ll also use it to promote things we like, such as any future games we make, or where to get the latest merchandise for the game. Marketing will be kept tasteful, though.</p>

<p>One cool feature about the new launcher you might want to know about is that you can pass it command-line features! The syntax is:</p>

<p>Minecraft &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; &lt;server:port&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;username&gt; is the username you wish to log in as
&lt;password&gt; is your password. If this is set, the launcher will automatically start the game without waiting for you to press the button
&lt;server:port&gt; is an ip to a minecraft server. If this is set, the game will automatically connect to that server once the game has started.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Thanks for helping test this!</h3>    <div class="content">
      <p>The biggest problem so far seems to be the “too many failed log in attempts” bug. That’s caused by the server getting every one connecting to the server mixed up</p>
