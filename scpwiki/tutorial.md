<h1>This is the guide for SCP: Secret Laboratory.</h1>

First, you will spawn as one of four classes: Class-D, Scientist, Facility Guard, or SCP.

The Class-D’s objective is to escape the facility and avoid being killed by Scientists, Facility Guards, and SCPs to the class Chaos Insurgency.
The Scientist’s objective is to escape without being killed by Class-Ds or SCPs to the class Nine-Tailed Fox.
Facility Guards spawn to keep the facility under control.
And the SCPs’ role is straightforward — kill.

When you spawn as one of these roles, you can start playing right away.
As a Class-D or Scientist, you spawn in the Light Containment Zone. Class-Ds should look for a keycard, while Scientists already start with one.

For both classes, it’s best to go to SCP-914. This SCP is not dangerous and cannot kill you. It’s a machine that can upgrade or downgrade items you put inside. Set the knob to “Fine” to upgrade your chosen item.

After that, you have two options:

Get out of the zone before it becomes dangerous, or

Go to the Armory, gear up, and kill the opposite class (depending on which one you are).

Before escaping the Light Containment Zone, you’ll need a strong enough keycard. After that, you’ll reach the Heavy Containment Zone, which houses most of the SCPs — so be careful.

Along the way, you can pick up SCP items, which are mostly safe but can sometimes kill you. After all the chaos in the Heavy Zone, you’ll move on to the Entrance Zone, which contains two gates that require even stronger keycards. After that, you can finally escape through the elevators and head to the Surface Zone. At the end, there’s a tunnel going down — if you go through it, you’ll escape.
Facility Guards spawn in the Entrance Zone and don’t really have to complete any major objectives except to help Scientists escape and to kill or cuff D-Class.

Now you know what to do when you spawn, but when you’re escaping, you might run into some trouble — that trouble being the NTF or the Chaos Insurgency.

NTF (Nine-Tailed Fox) have a task force whose goal is to kill all Class-Ds, Chaos Insurgents, and SCPs.

CI (Chaos Insurgency) have the other task to kill Scientists, Facility Guards, M/NTF's and SCPs. They mostly cause chaos in the facility, like turning on nuclear warhead or making bad for scps

While playing, you can also activate the nuclear warhead in the Heavy Zone to destroy the facility in 90 seconds. However, other players (including SCPs) can turn it off. On the Surface, there’s another warhead control room with a button — one of two in total. To use it, you’ll need an even higher-level 05 keycard.

If the round goes on too long without any spawn waves, the Dead Man Sequence will trigger — a warhead that cannot be turned off.

So on my side i will tell you about keycards and stuff that you would find in the facility. Like guns, medicaments, and more about scps

<h2>Starting from Keycards:</h3>
The keycards have levels, points.
So there is three things the cards can access: Rooms, Armory, Other
If there is bigger count of points on cards it have bigger privileges than lower cards
Every Thing, doors, armory, chambers have different requirements for cards.

<h3>SCP's</h3>

So i will tell more about scp-xxx anomalies, but thier main goal is to kill all classes and win the round. They have different abilities.
Some SCP's aren't anomalies some are items that you can get with the keycard.

<h4>Anomalies</h4>
SCP-049 - Famous old style scientist that tried to cure Pestilence virus. He instead kills people and makes them into:

SCP-049-2 - As i said the people who get killed and then "resurrected" into zombies that kill other classes. They are the worst scp that exist in the game.

SCP-079 - The Old AI or know as Technician who controls the facility and helps scp's to win, he can kill people by the tesla gate. To kill him you need to turn all of the generators and wait, there will be good loot and a red button that you shoot

SCP-096 - Big white creature that gets really mad if you look at him, he have really good speed and instantly kills if he is angry.

SCP-106 - The silence man who likes silence but in this scp game he attacks players and sends them to Pocket dimension where players die or get lucky and escape. This haves few things more! When you press Tab button you can go with that to nearby room with that. Pressing shift makes you go to the ground and silently go to other place.

SCP-173 - This model not original and it's reworked heavly the [real](https://www.scaithebathhouse.com/en/exhibitions/2005/04/izumi_kato/) model. So this is like teleporting scp, if you look at it, it cannot attack you but if you look away he instantly kills you.

That's it for this list next is:

<h3>SCP Items</h3>

For this list i will not tell the event specific things but here are items that give abilities:

SCP-207 - Coca Cola it gives speed but lowers health slowly.

SCP-127 - My favorite, it's a gun that gives you AHP and talks to you, it's kinda funny that weapon talks to you but it helps really well.
