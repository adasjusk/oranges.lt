Legacy Launcher Update

With the approaching transition from Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, we will need to end support for Windows XP and Windows Vista. This will also result in the end of support for the legacy launcher. You can read more about the account migration here: https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-Java-Account-Migration-FAQ.

Effective in Q2 2021, we will end support for both platforms and the legacy launcher. Your account will remain and will be able to be played through the new launcher even after this event, as long as we are able to identify your account can be played.
