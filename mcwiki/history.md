So everything started on 2018 July 21 when was created 1st server of mine, it was ltuservermc.

It was created for my friends and classmates. then it was little bit destroyed by griefers...
We created ltuservermc 2.0 it was bigger like 2x times than 1.0 and it also died very quickly, because of versions changes and of work completions.

From that I youtubed little bit and then stopped because idk how to youtube :D (btw there was supposed to be a youtube video kinda cringe but yeah it was war server between aukštaityja and Latvia these were cities names)

Aukštaityja. They were much more prepared and bigger than the Latvia. So after the war burokėlis (the main creator of the server, who robbed the enchanted beetroot) placed it in between two villages and both cities were happy and that's how this server ended.

But i learned how to create a server, and then all of servers hosted on aternos.org, and now on my host that was better than aternos potato servers (thanks, aternos) so my potato server hosted burokiškės 2.0

that was lifesteal server and it had a lot of player that were hungry for hearts and 1 st week was chaotic, kinda server was big and it had better player base than all previous servers combined. it had wars but they were not documented so the best war was for the hearts

and it was small so small percentage who know about it. Then on my side I upgraded server to 16 GB of ram and stolen from trash (it wasn't) cpu Intel Core I5, because it was previously 2 GB of ram and Intel Celeron... So the server ended because players left of inactivity same for other servers. Also Burokiškės 1 and 2 exist if im not wrong in Oranges server? idk i need to fact check, but i will continue story, so after burokiškės i discontinued agreement to host Burokiškės on my server. So I started new Anarchy based and Bigger and with new computer that was better for the server. It was chill at first with a lot of spies. So the server had a lot of updates. server's player base was something around: 10 ~ players.

so this server will be alive for longest that i can make it to and it will be best of the best. but someone deleted our servers and orange mc got shutdown, so i made revision 2 of the server and kept spawn but everything other got lost.
